HERE ARE THE STEPS TO IDENTIFY AND RESPOND TO A PISHING EMAIL:

Check the Email Address:

Look at the sender's email address. Make sure it matches your HR department's official email.
Verify the Sender:

Hover over or click on the sender's name to see their full email address. Confirm it's a legitimate HR contact.
Check for Mistakes:

Read the email for spelling and grammar errors. Legitimate HR communications are usually well-written.
Look at the Greeting:

Real HR emails often use your name. Be cautious if the email starts with a generic greeting like "Dear Employee."
Watch for Urgency:

Be careful if the email is urgent and pressures you to act quickly. Phishing emails often create a sense of urgency.
Examine Links:

Hover over any links to see where they lead. Only click if you're sure it's a legitimate HR link.
Check the Email Format:

Legitimate HR emails have a consistent look. Watch for strange fonts or logos.
Avoid Sharing Personal Info:

HR usually doesn't ask for personal info via email. Don't share passwords or sensitive details.
Watch Attachments:

Be cautious with unexpected attachments. Confirm with HR before opening them.
Look for Signatures:

Legitimate HR emails often have a proper signature. Lack of one can be a warning sign.
Trust Your Feelings:

If something feels off, double-check. Contact HR through a known method to verify.
Remember, your HR department cares about your security. If in doubt, reach out to them directly through a trusted channel to confirm any unusual requests or emails.
