step03 :

SINGLE CRACK MODE OF JOHN THE RIPPER
Username and Password:

John the Ripper Flags:
If we were to use John the Ripper in single-crack mode, the command might look something like this:
$ john --single --format=raw-sha1 crack.txt


DICTIONARY ATTACK
In dictionary mode, we give John the Ripper a list of potential passwords, and it checks them against a given password hash. Here's an example using the RockYou wordlist:
Wordlist:
We have a list of passwords called the RockYou wordlist. You can find it on Kali Linux at /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.
Password Hash:
We have a password hash: edba955d0ea15fdef4f61726ef97e5af507430c0
John the Ripper Command:
We tell John to use the RockYou wordlist and the provided password hash to try and find the password. The command looks like this:
$ john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --format=raw-sha1 crack.txt
Result:
John compares the passwords from the wordlist with the given hash (edba955d0ea15fdef4f61726ef97e5af507430c0), and it quickly finds a match.
