Step 1: Download and Install VirtualBox
Visit the VirtualBox website and download the latest version of VirtualBox for your operating system.
Follow the installation instructions provided for your specific operating system.


Step 2: Download Kali Linux ISO
Visit the Kali Linux download page and download the Kali Linux ISO image.
Choose the appropriate version for your system (e.g., 64-bit or 32-bit).


Step 3: Create a New Virtual Machine
Open VirtualBox and click on "New" to create a new virtual machine.
Enter a name for your virtual machine (e.g., "Kali Linux").
Choose "Linux" as the type and "Debian" as the version.
Allocate at least 2 GB of RAM (2048 MB).
Create a new virtual hard disk, and choose the size (20 GB or more is recommended).


Step 4: Configure Virtual Machine Settings
Select the newly created virtual machine and click on "Settings."
Under "System," uncheck "Floppy" in the Boot Order tab.
Under "Processor," allocate multiple CPU cores if available.
Under "Display," increase the video memory to at least 128 MB.
Under "Storage," select the empty disk, click on the disk icon next to "Controller: IDE," and choose the Kali Linux ISO you downloaded earlier.


Step 5: Install Kali Linux
Start the virtual machine.
Kali Linux will boot from the ISO. Follow the on-screen instructions to install the operating system.
During the installation process, you will be prompted to set up a root password and create a user account.
When the installation completes, eject the ISO from the virtual CD/DVD drive and press Enter to reboot.
